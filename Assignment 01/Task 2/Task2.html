        <h1>BLACK HOLE</h1>
        <p>A <b>black hole</b> is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.

            Because no light can get out, people can't see <b>black hole</b>. They are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help find <b>black holes</b>. The special tools can see how stars that are very close to <b>black holes</b> act differently than other stars.

            <u>Could a Black Hole Destroy Earth?</u>
<br>
Black holes do not go around in space eating stars, moons and planets. Earth will not fall into a <b>black holes</b> because no <b>black holes</b> is close enough to the solar system for Earth to do that.

Even if a <b>black holes</b> the same mass as the sun were to take the place of the sun, Earth still would not fall in. The <b>black holes</b> would have the same gravity as the sun. Earth and the other planets would orbit the <b>black holes</b> as they orbit the sun now.

The sun will never turn into a <b>black holes</b>. The sun is not a big enough star to make a <b>black holes</b>.

            <u>How Is <i>NASA</i> Studying <b>black holes</b>?</u>
        <br>
            <i>NASA</i> is using satellites and telescopes that are traveling in space to learn more about <b>black holes</b>. These spacecraft help scientists answer questions about the universe. </p>
